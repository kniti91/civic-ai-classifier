# civic-ai-classifier
civic-ai-classifier is an open-source project designed to identify and categorize civic issues from images using computer vision and deep learning. It aims to assist city governments, civic apps, and community initiatives by automating the classification of common infrastructure problems such as:

Potholes

Waterlogging

Garbage dumps

Open manholes

Cracked or broken roads

Built with PyTorch, the project includes tools for model training, prediction, API integration via FastAPI, and extensibility for custom civic datasets.
